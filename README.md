I am Elena (she/her) - Welcome to my GitHub space! :sparkles:

I am currently training to become a web developer with the amazing people of [@foundersandcoders](https://github.com/foundersandcoders) (FAC22 Autumn Cohort) :star_struck:

In my previous life I used to work in the music world, either producing music for artists and media or teaching people piano and classical composition. :radio: :violin:

:heart: I fell in love with CSS first, when I tried to make a replica of my beloved [Vintage Yamaha Reface CP](https://elenamarinaki.github.io/vintage_piano_replica/) piano for fun! (check the [code](https://github.com/elenamarinaki/vintage_piano_replica)) :musical_keyboard:

:tornado: Fast forward one year later, I am spending all my free (and most often all of my not free :hand_over_mouth:) time learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript and other web candy :lollipop: I discover everyday. My most recent find is Figma :gem: and my current obsession is APIs and exploring the intricate rules of concurrency along with the DOM :nerd_face:
