I am Elena (she/her) - Welcome to my GitHub space! :sparkles:

I am currently training to become a web developer with the amazing people of [@foundersandcoders](https://github.com/foundersandcoders) (FAC22 Autumn Cohort) :star_struck:

In my previous life I used to work in the music world, either producing music for artists and media or teaching people piano and classical composition. :radio: :violin:

:heart: I fell in love with CSS first, when I tried to make a replica of my beloved [Vintage Yamaha Reface CP](https://elenamarinaki.github.io/vintage_piano_replica/) piano for fun! (check the [code](https://github.com/elenamarinaki/vintage_piano_replica)) :musical_keyboard:

:tornado: Fast forward one year later, I have graduated form the `Founders & Coders` bootcamp in London and now spending my time either learning a new framework, studying databases or building something new for the company I am working with :lollipop:.

My goal is to be able to work on full-stack development and keep learning more about new technologies and testing, exploring the different types and how it's being used in the industry for more effective production and better products. ðŸ§ª
