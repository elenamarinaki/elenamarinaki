I am Elena (she/her) - Welcome to my GitHub space! :sparkles:

I recently completed my training to become a web developer with the amazing people of [@foundersandcoders](https://github.com/foundersandcoders) (FAC22 Autumn Cohort) :star_struck:

In my previous life I used to work in the music world, either producing music for artists and media or teaching people piano and classical composition. :radio: :violin:

:heart: I fell in love with CSS and JavaScript first, when I tried to make a replica of my beloved [Vintage Yamaha Reface CP](https://elenamarinaki.github.io/vintage_piano_replica/) piano for fun! (check the [code](https://github.com/elenamarinaki/vintage_piano_replica)) :musical_keyboard:

:tornado: Fast forward almost two years later, today, I have graduated form the `Founders & Coders` bootcamp in London and now spending my time either learning a new technology or building something new for the company I am working with :lollipop:.

I am currently working on full-stack development, which I am enjoying so much as I get to see things coming to life from beginning to end :)
