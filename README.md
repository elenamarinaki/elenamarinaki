I am Elena (she/her) - Welcome to my GitHub space! :sparkles:

In 2021 I completed my training to become a web developer with the amazing people of [@foundersandcoders](https://github.com/foundersandcoders) (FAC22 Autumn Cohort) :star_struck:

In my previous life I used to work in the music world, either producing music for artists and media or teaching people piano and classical composition. :radio: :violin:

:heart: When I first fell in love with CSS and JavaScript, I tried to make a replica of my beloved [Vintage Yamaha Reface CP](https://elenamarinaki.github.io/vintage_piano_replica/) piano for fun! (check the [code](https://github.com/elenamarinaki/vintage_piano_replica)) :musical_keyboard:

‚ö°Ô∏è Since 2021, I have been working at Companion Studio in London, where I get the chance to build a variety of projects using a very diverse stack: React - Netx.js, Typescript, Sanity CMS, GraphQL - Prisma - PostgreSQL Databases, Astro, Node.js, React Native, tRPC.io, React-Query, Jest, Cypress, Stitches, Tailwind and many more!

I enjoy exploring new technologies and compare them with the ones I already know. This way I understand the core concepts of programming in a more intuitive way while having fun :) 

Lastly, I enjoy reading tech blogs and technical writing. This is why I recently started my own blog at Hashnode - you can check my first article [here](https://elenamarinaki.hashnode.dev/graphql-vs-trpc)!
